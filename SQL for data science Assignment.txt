
Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 rows
--Finding total number of data in attribute table
select * from attribute

ii. Business table =10000 rows
--Finding total number of data in business table
select * from business


iii. Category table =10000 rows
select * from category

iv. Checkin table = 10000 rows
select * from checkin

v. elite_years table = 10000 rows
select * from elite_years


vi. friend table = 10000 rows
select * from friend

vii. hours table = 10000 rows
select * from hours

viii. photo table = 10000 rows
select * from photo

ix. review table = 10000 rows
select * from review


x. tip table = 10000 rows
select * from tip

xi. user table =10000 rows
select * from user	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please 
specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 rows
Primary key - id

Sample Code
select count (distinct id)
from 
business 

ii. Hours =1562

foreign key - business_id

Code
select count (distinct business_id)
from 
hours

iii. Category =2643 
foreign key - business_id

Code
select count (distinct business_id)
from 
category

iv. Attribute = 1115 
foreign key - business_id

Code
select count (distinct business_id)
from 
attribute

v. Review = 8090
foreign key - business_id

Code
select count (distinct business_id)
from 
review


vi. Checkin = 493
foreign key - business_id

Code
select count (distinct business_id)
from 
checkin


vii. Photo =6493
foreign key - business_id

Code
select count (distinct business_id)
from 
photo

viii. Tip = 3979
foreign key - business_id

Code
select count (distinct business_id)
from 
tip

ix. User = 10000
Primary Key - id

select count (distinct id)
from 
user


x. Friend = 11

select count (distinct user_id)
from 
friend


xi. Elite_years =2780
select count (distinct user_id)
from 
elite_years


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select * from user
	where name is null or review_count is null or yelping_since is null or useful is null 
		or funny is null or cool is null or fans is null or average_stars is null 
		or compliment_hot is null or compliment_more is null or compliment_profile is null 
		or compliment_cute is null or compliment_list is null or compliment_note is null 
		or compliment_plain is null or compliment_cool is null or compliment_funny is null 
		or compliment_writer is null or compliment_photos is null
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:5		avg:3.7082
	
	Sample code:
	select min(stars) as min, max(stars) as max, avg(stars) as avg
	from review
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:	5	avg:3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:2		avg:0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:1		max:	53	avg:1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:0		max:2000		avg:24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	select city,
	sum(review_count) as total_reviews

	from 
	business
	group by city
	order by total_reviews desc
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	city            | total_reviews |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses 
with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	Yes, the two groups have different distribution of hours. The city chosen is 'Toronto' and category is Restaurants.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
         Yes, they have different number of reviews

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

	Tow of the restaurants with 2-3 stars are located in 'Downtown Core'.

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and 
the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
	
 is_open | Total_Number | avg(review_count) |    avg(stars) |
+---------+--------------+-------------------+---------------+

+---------+--------------+-------------------+---------------+	
i. Difference 1:
      The average of stars for the closed businesses are less compared to the opened one's   
         
ii. Difference 2:

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the 
data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies
 between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples 
to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   
	I am trying to analyse the top 10 category with highest stars and each category having more than 10 businesses. Analyze the relationship with 
average review count.       
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
        For the analysis I need data from business table and category table. The stars are in the business table and category are in the category table.
 So, I have to join both of these tables. I have grouped the data by category column. Then I have calculated the average stars and average review count.
 I have counted the total business in each category and selected the categories having more than 10 businesses. The data is displayed in descending order
of average star to find the category with highest stars.
                     
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
SELECT 
 c.category,
 count(c.business_id) as total_business,
 avg(b.stars) as avg_stars,
 avg(b.review_count) as avg_review_count
 
FROM 
 business b
 inner join 
 category c
 on b.id = c.business_id

GROUP BY c.category
having total_business>10
order by avg_stars desc, avg_review_count desc
